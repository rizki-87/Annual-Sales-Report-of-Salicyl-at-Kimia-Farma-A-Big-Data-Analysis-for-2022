**Project Background**

As a Big Data Analyst Intern at Kimia Farma, this project entails the development of a dashboard to visualize the sales data of the Salicyl Brand over a one-year period. This task is part of a four-week learning process, designed to immerse us in the day-to-day responsibilities of a Big Data Analyst. From processing raw data to creating a comprehensive dashboard, this project encompasses all key aspects of big data analysis.

**Workflow**

The project is divided into several key stages:

- Data Overview and Transformation: Utilizing Google Colab and Python, we conducted an initial review of the sales data. The original data, in Excel format, was converted to CSV for easier processing.
- Database Creation: Using DBeaver, we developed a PostgreSQL database. This database consists of 6 main tables supporting data analysis.
- Data Mart Development: We built a data mart, including both base and aggregate data, to facilitate analysis and visualization.
- Query Development for Visualization: Specialized queries were prepared to assist in creating tables for data visualization. These tables were then integrated into Google Data Studio.
- Creation of the Salicyl Brand Sales Dashboard: The final step involved developing an interactive dashboard using Google Data Studio. This dashboard presents a one-year sales analysis of the Salicyl Brand, offering key insights and sales trends in a visually comprehensible format.

**Technologies Used**

Python & Google Colab: For initial data processing and transformation.
PostgreSQL & DBeaver: For database creation and management.
